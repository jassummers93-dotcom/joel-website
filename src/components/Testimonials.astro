    quote: "I worked closely with Joel for six years as his lead and manager. He was a key part of our audio team, contributing to the sound of WRC and Dirt Rally 2.0. Joel brings a wide range of talents - from audio editing, field and studio recording, to mixing and creative sound design. He's highly skilled in technical audio work, especially with Wwise and Unreal Engine, and has a great ability to troubleshoot and problem-solve. On top of that, he's one of the kindest people I've worked with -always receptive to feedback and consistently delivers. Joel would be a valuable asset to any company.",

    quote: "I worked alongside Joel for four years and managed him directly for one. As a senior generalist sound designer, he contributed to nearly every aspect of multiple games' audio and owned several key features. Joel's strengths are his creativity, technical skill in Unreal, and his ability to learn quickly, making him valuable across a broad range of tasks. He represented audio in cross-discipline meetings and led on features like UI sound, environmental ambience, and vehicle audio with precision. He would be a strong addition to any audio team and is clearly on the path to a lead role.",
